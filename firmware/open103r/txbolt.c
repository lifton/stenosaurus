#include "txbolt.h"

#include "stroke.h"
#include <inttypes.h>

// In the TX Bolt protocol, there are four sets of keys grouped in order from
// left to right. Each byte represents all the keys that were pressed in that
// set. The first two bits indicate which set this byte represents. The next
// bits are set if the corresponding key was pressed for the stroke.
//
// 00XXXXXX 01XXXXXX 10XXXXXX 110XXXXX
//   HWPKTS   UE*OAR   GLBPRF    #ZDST
//
// The protocol uses variable length packets of one, two, three or four bytes.
// Only those bytes for which keys were pressed will be transmitted. The bytes
// arrive in order of the sets so it is clear when a new stroke starts. Also, if
// a key is pressed in an earlier set in one stroke and then a key is pressed
// only in a later set then there will be a zero byte to indicate that this is a
// new stroke. So, it is reliable to assume that a stroke ended when a lower set
// is seen. Additionally, if there is no activity then the machine will send a
// zero byte every few seconds.
//
// In this implementation of the protocol we send a zero byte after each stroke
// regardless of it being necessary. It is believed by the implementor that this
// should be compatible with any software that is prepared to receive  this
// protocol. The benefit is that it makes the protocol implementation  stateless
// and reduces delay issues for the final stroke.
